# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Interactive Web App)

A clean and interactive **Tic-Tac-Toe web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project focuses on **clear game logic, good user experience, and maintainable code**, rather than unnecessary complexity.

---

##  Key Highlights
- Two-player gameplay (Player X vs Player O)
- Accurate **win and draw detection**
- Proper game state management to prevent invalid moves
- Smooth UI animations for better interaction
- Sound effects for moves, wins, and draws
- Responsive layout using CSS Flexbox
- Simple, intuitive, and beginner-friendly design

---

##  Design Decisions
- The game intentionally avoids over-engineering (AI, multiplayer) to keep logic clean and readable
- A single **New Game** flow ensures a simple and intuitive user experience
- State variables (`count`, `gameOver`) ensure reliable gameplay behavior
- Animations and sounds are lightweight and enhance UX without distraction

---

##  Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – Structure and semantics  
- **CSS3** – Styling, animations, and responsive layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Game logic, DOM manipulation, and state handling
